# ScreenCaptor
Simple Android library to capture screenshots deterministically

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wealthfront/screencaptor.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wealthfront/screencaptor)
[![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.wealthfront/screencaptor/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.wealthfront/screencaptor)

## Features
* Capture a screenshot of any Activity in your integration tests
* Hide Views from your screenshots (Eg. Dates, Account Value, etc)
* Override View's contents for screenshot purposes
* Globally modify certain types of Views, e.g. hiding scrollbars or cursors

## Download

Add this dependency in your build.gradle:

```groovy
implementation 'com.wealthfront:screencaptor:2.1.1'
```

## How do I capture a screenshot?
The simplest way to capture a screenshot is to just pass in the view to be screenshotted with a name for the screenshot when you want to take one.
```kotlin
ScreenCaptor.takeScreenshot(view = rootView, screenshotName = "my_favorite_screenshot")
```

There are other configurations that you can pass in as well,

* `screenshotNameSuffix` - for any suffix that you want to attach to your screenshot
* `viewMutations` - takes in a set of [ViewMutation]s which will modify specific views. These mutations are automatically rolled back after the screeenshot is taken
* `globalViewMutations` - takes in a set of [GlobalViewMutation]s which will modify the entire view
* `screenshotDirectory` - specify which directory you want to save the screenshot in (sdcard/screenshots/ by default)
* `screenshotFormat` - whether the format needs to be JPEG, PNG or WEBP (PNG by default)
* `screenshotQuality` - specify the quality of the screenshot (Best quality by default)

Here's an example of a complex ScreenCaptor setup:

```kotlin
ScreenCaptor.takeScreenshot(
  activityScenario = myActivityScenario,
  screenshotName = "my_favorite_screenshot",
  screenshotNameSuffix = "latest",
  viewMutations = setOf(
    ViewMutationImpl(
      allOf(withId(R.id.secondaryValue), isDescendantOfA(withId(R.id.infoCard))),
      VisibilityViewMutator(View::class.java, INVISIBLE)
    )
  ), 
  globalViewMutations = emptySet(),
  screenshotFormat = JPEG,
  screenshotQuality = BEST
)
```

## Why is screencaptor more deterministic?
When researching a way to properly take screenshots of a select view deterministically, we couldn't really find a simple framework that did just that and did it well. So, we went ahead and developed this framework for taking screenshots as deterministically as much as possible.

### Manually drawing on a Canvas

Instead of using AndroidX's implementation of screenshot which utilizes the UiAutomator to take a screenshot, we manually draw the screen's content onto a bitmap canvas. This is a much more direct approach and ultimately leads to the screenshot process being the most native and close to the metal.

### Handling Dynamic data within views

This is a pretty common case that we run into where we have a dynamic piece of data displayed on the view that might change with every run of the test. The classic example is any date that gets displayed on the screen. And for this, we have a way of disabling/hiding these views when we take the screenshot using the **VisibilityViewMutator**. This turns the views to be  **INVISIBLE** right before taking the screenshot and turns the views to their initial state after the screenshot is taken.

### Disabling cursor and scrollbars

Cursors and scrollbars show up in EditTexts and ScrollViews in an inconsistent manner and having that enabled means that it might make our screenshots more flaky. So to address that issue, we have the  **ViewTreeMutator** which walks through the view hierarchy and disables scrollbars and cursors whenever applicable.

These techniques allow our screenshot framework to be free of flakiness as much as possible and makes it pretty extensible.

## How we use screencaptor
We use screencaptor to capture screenshots in various places in our app when running our integration tests and compare the screenshot on master with any new PR that gets created. This helps us narrow down on any visual changes that happens with our app. Like so.

This helps us address a class of bugs before our app rolls out to production :)
