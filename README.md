# ScreenCaptor TEST
Simple Android library to capture screenshots deterministically

## Features
* Capture a screenshot of any view in your integration tests
* Dynamically hide views from your screenshots (Eg. Dates, Account Value, etc)
* Use `ViewMutators` to mutate various types of views as needed

## Download

Add this dependency in your build.gradle:

```groovy
implementation 'com.wealthfront:screencaptor:0.1.0'
```

## How do I capture a screenshot?
The simplest way to capture a screenshot is to just pass in the view to be screenshotted with a name for the screenshot when you want to take one.
```kotlin
ScreenCaptor.takeScreenshot(view = rootView, screenshotFilename = "my_favorite_screenshot")
```

There are other configurations that you can pass in as well,

* `screenshotNameSuffix` - for any suffix that you want to attach to your screenshot
* `viewIdsToExclude` - takes in a set of ids to exclude from the screenshot
* `viewMutators` - allows you to mutate the subclasses of views in any particular way (Hides scrollbars and cursors by default)
* `screenshotDirectory` - specify which directory you want to save the screenshot in (sdcard/screenshots/ by default)
* `screenshotFormat` - whether the format needs to be JPEG, PNG or WEBP (PNG by default)
* `screenshotQuality` - specify the quality of the screenshot (Best quality by default)

**Note**: You can disable the default mutators by passing in an empty set for the `viewMutators` argument in the `takeScreenshot` method.

Here's an example of a complex screencaptor setup:

```kotlin
ScreenCaptor.takeScreenshot(
  view = rootView,
  screenshotFilename = "my_favorite_screenshot",
  screenshotNameSuffix = "latest",
  viewIdsToExclude = setOf(R.id.date, R.id.account_value),
  screenshotFormat = JPEG,
  screenshotQuality = BEST
)
```

## Why is screencaptor more deterministic?
When researching a way to properly take screenshots of a select view deterministically, we couldn't really find a simple framework that did just that and did it well. So, we went ahead and developed this framework for taking screenshots as deterministically as much as possible.

### Manually drawing on a Canvas

Instead of using AndroidX's implementation of screenshot which utilizes the UiAutomator to take a screenshot, we manually draw the screen's content onto a bitmap canvas. This is a much more direct approach and ultimately leads to the screenshot process being the most native and close to the metal.

### Posting to the MainThread

Another measure we take to improve the determinism is to post to the front of the message queue on the main thread. We do this so that the screenshot is taken as soon as the user requests it. Taking screenshots is a unit of work that doesn't not have any shared mutable state with any other part of the app so this does not cause any issues. This is usually a dangerous thing to do, but in this case it makes sense. We also have to do this operation in the main thread since we will be mutating views visibility of certain dynamic views.

### Handling Dynamic data within views

This is a pretty common case that we run into where we have a dynamic piece of data displayed on the view that might change with every run of the test. The classic example is any date that gets displayed on the screen. And for this, we have a way of disabling/hiding these views when we take the screenshot using the  **ViewVisibilityModifier**. This turns the views to be  **INVISIBLE** right before taking the screenshot and turns the views to their initial state after the screenshot is taken.

### Disabling cursor and scrollbars

Cursors and scrollbars show up in EditTexts and ScrollViews in an inconsistent manner and having that enabled means that it might make our screenshots more flaky. So to address that issue, we have the  **ViewTreeMutator** which walks through the view hierarchy and disables scrollbars and cursors whenever applicable.

These techniques allow our screenshot framework to be free of flakiness as much as possible and makes it pretty extensible.

## How we use screencaptor
We use screencaptor to capture screenshots in various places in our app when running our integration tests and compare the screenshot on master with any new PR that gets created. This helps us narrow down on any visual changes that happens with our app. Like so.

This helps us address a class of bugs before our app rolls out to production :)
